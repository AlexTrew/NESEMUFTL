**** addressing modes
***** immediate addressing
this is the simplest addressing mode for an instruction type:
the first byte contains the opcode and the second contains the data
**** opcodes
***** processing opcodes
read the opcode,
lookup the instruction info in the table (make a table!)
determine how many cycles are needed.
if no cycles needed, read the next instruction.
